### Hi there 👋

I am Rafael, I am 17 years old and I love programming. I started programming at 12. In my github you will probably find my non-organised projects so excuse me for that 😅. However,  I hope I can help with my projects.   

### ⚒ The minecraft server project:

We worked with some friends on a minecraft server. I made the [Moderation Plugin](https://github.com/raffon-jar/InventoryManager), the [Pitchout Plugin](https://github.com/raffon-jar/pitchout) ( You have a knockback stick and you need to push people off the platform ), the [Arena Plugin](https://github.com/raffon-jar/arena) ( FFA ) and with a friend we made the [Survival Plugin](https://github.com/raffon-jar/survie) ( A survival a bit like the city of the elements made by siphano )

### 💎 The websites I made:
- [Teska Skateboards](https://teskaskateboard.site) (It is a webshop for a company selling skateboards and t-shirts)
- [Pupils' Committee of EEB3](https://eebtech.eu/blog) (I made the pupils' committee website of my school)
- [Clocks](https://eebtech.eu/clock) (A small system used to create clocks for exams in my school. The timers are synchro between the computers)
- [Bal Du Bac 2022](https://eebtech.eu/bdb) (A small website created to manage the sales of the anual bal of our school)

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- [Inventory Manager](https://github.com/raffon-jar/InventoryManager)
- A super webshop laravel pack

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- PHP laravel
- React.js
- Minecraft Forge and Bukkit
