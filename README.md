### 🔭 I'm Currently Working On

* **Graph-Based Analysis of PROMETHEE II Matrices:** As part of my master's research, I am developing a project in Multi-Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). I'm implementing a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to analyze preference graphs to extract ranking information and identify inconsistencies (cycles).

### 🚀 Pinned Projects

* **[Metaheuristic Optimization for Fair Tournament Scheduling](https://github.com/rafael-jar/Tournament-Scheduling-Metaheuristics)**
    * Designed and benchmarked Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) to find near-optimal solutions for this NP-hard problem.
    * Conducted a comparative analysis of these metaheuristics against exact Linear Programming methods based on solution quality and computational efficiency.
