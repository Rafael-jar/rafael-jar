### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rafael, I am 18 years old and I love programming. I started programming at 12. In my github you will probably find my non-organised projects so excuse me for that ðŸ˜…. However,  I hope I can help with my projects.   

### âš’ The minecraft server project:

We worked with some friends on a minecraft server. I made the [Moderation Plugin](https://github.com/raffon-jar/InventoryManager), the [Pitchout Plugin](https://github.com/raffon-jar/pitchout) ( You have a knockback stick and you need to push people off the platform ), the [Arena Plugin](https://github.com/raffon-jar/arena) ( FFA ) and with a friend we made the [Survival Plugin](https://github.com/raffon-jar/survie) ( A survival a bit like the city of the elements made by siphano )

### ðŸ’Ž The websites I made:
- [Teska Skateboards](https://rafael-jar.github.io/teska) (It is a webshop for a company selling skateboards and t-shirts)
- [Pupils' Committee of EEB3](https://rafael-jar.github.io/cde) (I made the pupils' committee website of my school)
- [Bal Du Bac 2022](https://rafael-jar.github.io/bdb) (A small website created to manage the sales of the anual bal of our school)

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Some minecraft plugins
- A simple MVC php framework for my future websites
- Mini python scripts for windows

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- PHP Laravel
- React.js
