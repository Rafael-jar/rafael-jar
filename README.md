# Rafael Palma Santos 

> Aspiring AI Researcher with a focus on Optimization and Probabilistic Models. 

Hi there! I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the Ecole polytechnique de Bruxelles. I am passionate about applying a strong mathematical background to complex Machine Learning challenges.

### 🔭 I'm Currently Working On

* **Graph-Based Analysis of PROMETHEE II Matrices:** As part of my master's research, I am developing a project in Multi-Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). I'm implementing a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to analyze preference graphs to extract ranking information and identify inconsistencies (cycles).

### 🚀 Pinned Projects

* **[Metaheuristic Optimization for Fair Tournament Scheduling](https://github.com/rafael-jar/Tournament-Scheduling-Metaheuristics)**
    * Designed and benchmarked Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) to find near-optimal solutions for this NP-hard problem.
    * Conducted a comparative analysis of these metaheuristics against exact Linear Programming methods based on solution quality and computational efficiency.
    * 
* * **[Optimizing the UPGMA Algorithm]((https://github.com/Rafael-jar/Phylogenetic-Tree-Upgma))**
    A group project for my advanced algorithms course where we focused on optimizing the UPGMA algorithm for phylogenetic tree construction. We experimented with four different data structures, successfully reducing the time complexity from a terrible $\theta(n^4)$ down to an efficient **$\theta(n^2log~n)$** by using a custom key class with a combination of `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`.

* **[Bloom Filter Analysis](https://github.com/Rafael-jar/Bloom-Filter-Project)**
    A C++ project for my Randomized Algorithms class. I built a Bloom filter from scratch using double hashing for efficiency. The main goal was to experimentally test the false positive rate against the theoretical formula $k=(m/n)ln(2)$, and I found some interesting anomalies where the theory breaks down at extreme (very small or very large) *n* values.
